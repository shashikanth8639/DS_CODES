we can detect cycle in directed graphs in many ways:
    
    1.Using DFS (visited and recStack)
    2.Using Coloring (white, gray and black)
    3.Using kahn's algorithm (BFS)
        --- calculate indegree of each vertex, if indegree == 0 push into queue
            pop the element from the queue, decrease indegree of neighbours by 1
            if indegree(neighbours) == 0 push them into queue !!!!while q!=[]
        --- if number of pops == number of vertices:
                -No cycle
        ---> If we modify above algorithm and use heap data structure instead of 
                queue while heappopping push them into array and
                    - if no cycles:
                        print(arr)
